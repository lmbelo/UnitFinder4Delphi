Unit finder for Delphi applications - Find implementation unit of a target window at run-time

Hi, LMBelo here!

Makin' available an Delphi IDE extension for unit finder - It tries to find out a target window's implementation unit based.
It goes great when you're dealing with large projects with big amount of files and you got to open target window's unit.
Just set finder unit enabled on IDE and use finder's hotkey to try out.

See you.
